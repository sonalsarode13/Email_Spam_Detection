# Email_Spam_Detection

An email spam-detection machine learning model was developed using multiple algorithms. After performing extensive data preprocessing, algorithms such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree were applied. NLP preprocessing techniques including text lowercasing, removal of URLs, HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords, Tokenization along with stemming and lemmatization were implemented. Additionally, the TF-IDF technique was used to convert text data into numerical feature vectors. The model was then validated by inputting text data to accurately classify emails as spam or not spam.
